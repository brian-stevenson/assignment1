    WEB DESIGN EXPERIENCE:
      <li>
        I have some experience with basic HTML5 from an introductory class I took 3 years ago.
      </li>
      <li>
        Everything else in this class, including CSS and JS are completely new to me.
      </li>
      <li>
        I probably should have completed this before the in-class 1 assignment, as this feels like a slight step backward. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I am looking forward to gaining the ability to make well designed and visually appealing web pages!
